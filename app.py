### Communication & Culture Advantage (CCA) Profiler¬©
**CCA Profiler** is an evidence-based reflection tool designed to help participants identify and adapt their communication tendencies in diverse and multicultural workplaces.

This report benchmarks your ability to recognise, respect, and adapt to cultural differences so you can communicate and work effectively across diverse settings. It does not mean being an expert in every culture.

CCA emphasises staying consciously aware of your cultural surroundings, noticing the clues and cues in people's behaviours, communication styles, and expectations, and making informed judgments based on observations and facts rather than assumptions. At its core, CCA requires placing the interests, feelings, and cultural context of others alongside your own, recognising that what feels natural or "professional" in one culture may not be the same in another.

While not a psychometric assessment, the CCA Profiler draws on established, research-backed frameworks in organisational psychology, intercultural communication, and leadership studies.

**Communication & Culture Advantage Profiler**

This profiler‚Äîwhich will require 5 to 7 minutes of your time to complete‚Äîis designed to help you reflect on your personal communication style, your adaptability across cultures, and the way you use empathy in workplace conversations.

The CCAP is not a test ‚Äì there are no right or wrong answers. Instead, this tool will bolster your self-awareness of communication skills in diverse and international contexts.

When submitting this form, be sure to insert information (such as your **Name** and **Email Address**) you wish the system to record and retain ‚Äì this is used to create your Personal Communication Profile, issued to you prior to your workshop attendance or coaching sessions.

**Instructions**
Read each statement carefully and select the option that best reflects how true it is for you.

**Use the following 5-point scale:**
1 = Strongly Disagree
2 = Disagree
3 = Neutral
4 = Agree
5 = Strongly Agree

**Time required:** 5‚Äì7 minutes.

Your responses will be combined into an anonymous communication snapshot that we will explore together during the workshop. Your results will not be shared with anyone.

When you submit this form, it will not automatically collect your details like name and email address unless you provide it yourself.
