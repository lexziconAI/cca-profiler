### Communication & Culture Advantage (CCA) Profiler¬©
**CCA Profiler** is an evidence-based reflection tool designed to help participants identify and adapt their communication tendencies in diverse and multicultural workplaces.

This report benchmarks your ability to recognise, respect, and adapt to cultural differences so you can communicate and work effectively across diverse settings. It does not mean being an expert in every culture.

CCA emphasises staying consciously aware of your cultural surroundings, noticing the clues and cues in people's behaviours, communication styles, and expectations, and making informed judgments based on observations and facts rather than assumptions. At its core, CCA requires placing the interests, feelings, and cultural context of others alongside your own, recognising that what feels natural or "professional" in one culture may not be the same in another.

While not a psychometric assessment, the CCA Profiler draws on established, research-backed frameworks in organisational psychology, intercultural communication, and leadership studies.
